There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  Colorz.io

## Sub-Heading ##
  UI tool to assist developers in color selection

## Summary ##
  > The User Interface is an integral part of creating a good UX, and creating a good UX is at the core of creating a good product. The most successful user interfaces are created by talented designers who are closer to artists than developers. We aim to assist the "everyday" developer in creating an interface on par with those of their designer peers.

  Our product will assist developers in selecting the color scheme for their UI. We are researching color theory to seed the project with some of the best color schemes, and hope to allow our users to submit more combinations as time progresses. We will serve the best color schemes available to our users based on their needs.

## Problem ##
  > Our product helps engineers create elegant interfaces by selecting colors that mesh well together and fit with their product vision.

## Solution ##
  > In addition to the "generic" color picker outlined above, we will allow the user to declare what they would like their primary color to be, and serve them different color combinations based on their choice. We will render an example webpage with the selected color scheme to help inform the user's choice, and copy the relevant CSS directly to their clipboard for use on stylesheets.

## Quote from You ##
  > "Colorz.io is a lightweight tool to help a developer create the UI their product deserves."

## How to Get Started ##
  > In less than five minutes, anyone can generate a seamless color scheme for their app.

## Customer Quote ##
  > "I love developing small apps on my own time for fun, but they never end up looking how I imagine. Colorz.io helped me spin up a functional and fashionable interface in minutes."

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > Visit colorz.io now to get started -- what are you waiting for?!?
